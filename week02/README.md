# ANM_652_OL1: Introduction to Rigging

This repository contains my study notes and project progress for the **Introduction to Rigging** course at AnimSchool.

## Week 02 | Mesh Auditing & Topology Preparation

The focus of this week was on "Mesh Auditing"—the critical process of ensuring a 3D model is technically sound and optimized before the rigging process begins.

### 📑 Weekly Learning Modules
* **[01 Auditing the Mesh](./01_Auditing%20the%20Mesh.md)**: Learning how to inspect surface consistency and adjust Normals display size for better visibility.
* **[02 Deep Check](./02_Deep%20Check.md)**: Identifying and resolving topology issues such as Non-manifold geometry, Poles, and N-gons.
* **[03 CleanUp](./03_CleanUp.md)**: Utilizing Maya’s Cleanup tools, freezing transformations, and deleting history to "zero out" the model.
* **[04 Wrap-Up (UV)](./04_Wrap-Up(UV).md)**: Final verification of UV layouts and preparing the mesh for the rigging pipeline.

### 🛠 Tools & Skills Mastered
* **Mesh Integrity**: Detecting geometry errors that cause skinning artifacts.
* **Selection Constraints**: Efficiently isolating problematic faces (N-gons) in complex meshes.
* **Pipeline Readiness**: Understanding why a "clean" mesh is the foundation of a stable rig.
